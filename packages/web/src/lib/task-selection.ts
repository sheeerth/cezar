/**
 * The pure half of selecting rows in the Tasks table and editing them together: what a click on a
 * checkbox does, what the header checkbox says, and which bulk actions a given selection can
 * actually carry out.
 *
 * Pure on the same terms as `lib/tasks-table.ts` and `lib/task-groups.ts` — no React, no router,
 * no clock — because this is the behavior worth testing as a table, and because getting it wrong
 * is not cosmetic: a bulk action is N irreversible-ish writes at once.
 *
 * Two decisions the whole module rests on:
 *
 * 1. **A selection is a set of ids, and it is always read against the rows CURRENTLY ON SCREEN.**
 *    Nothing here trusts the set on its own. Rows leave the view constantly — a filter is typed,
 *    a status changes under an SSE patch, a run is archived — and an id that outlived its row
 *    must not be able to act. `selectionSummary` intersects the set with the visible list, and
 *    every action is built from that intersection, so a stale id is inert rather than dangerous.
 * 2. **An action offers itself only for the rows it would actually change.** Archiving a
 *    selection of five where two are already archived is a three-row action, and it says three.
 *    The alternative — sending five requests and calling two of them successes — reports work
 *    that never happened.
 */

/** The bulk edits the Tasks table offers. Deliberately the set that is undoable in one click:

 * Which runs, of those selected, each action would actually change.
 *
 * The gates are the SAME ones the single-row actions use elsewhere in the cockpit, deliberately:
 *
 *  - `archive` — not archived yet, and finished (`FINISHED_STATUSES`). A `review` run still wants
 *    a human, and the "Archive finished" broom has always refused to sweep one; a checkbox must
 *    not become the way around that rule.
 *  - `restore` — currently archived. No status gate: bringing a row back is undoing your own
 *    filing, and it is always safe.
 *  - `read` — currently unread (`isUnread`).
 *  - `unread` — currently read AND eligible to be unread at all (`canBeUnread`), which excludes
 *    cancelled, archived and still-running rows.
