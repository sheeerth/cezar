/**
 * The app's one connection to `GET /api/workspace/events`, and the two halves of the sync
 * doctrine (spec, "Architecture"): the stream is for immediacy, the REST endpoints are
 * authoritative, and on reconnect or a tab-visibility flip we refetch and reconcile.
 *
 * Immediacy is cache patching, not refetching: a live run emits a `run` event per step transition
 * and per token update, and invalidating the list on each would turn one agent into a request
 * flood against a server sharing this laptop's CPU with it. So events are folded into the cache
 * in place (events.ts), and the authoritative refetch happens exactly when we know we may have
 * missed something: at reconnect, and when a tab (or a phone that slept through an hour of the
 * run) comes back.
 *
 * Multi-project (spec, step 3.1): the one stream carries EVERY project's events, each stamped
 * with its owner. This layer unwraps the envelope (events.ts) and applies only the active
 * project's events — the mounted scope's, or the boot project's when unscoped — so the caches
 * (which are keyed by that same scope, queries.ts) never see another project's data. One
 * connection for the whole workspace, not one per project: same per-origin socket-budget
 * argument as ever, and a project switch changes the filter, not the socket.
 *
 * Provider authentication is host-wide rather than project-owned. Its dedicated unstamped event
 * bypasses that project filter and patches only an already-fetched workspace cache.
